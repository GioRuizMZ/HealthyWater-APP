This project is about a mobile app created in Android Studio using Java.
The app monitors and configures a water sensor device, displaying parameters such as pH, turbidity, conductivity, and more.
It connects to the device either through a network or locally via Bluetooth, allowing any user to monitor the data.
The code is shared for demonstration purposes.
In addition to monitoring, the app offers a cleaning service where users can schedule appointments, and a technician will perform the necessary work to keep the home's water clean and in optimal condition.
Currently, the monitoring services are not active because the device is turned off, but account management and the cleaning service are fully operational.
